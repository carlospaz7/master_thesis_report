\chapter*{Abstract}
Intelligent Tutoring Systems are gaining popularity for online learning. A recurrent problem is that teachers need more accurate monitoring tools that allow them to supervise and evaluate the work done by their students. 
Modern web tools provide functionality to detect user actions but they lack the capacity of correctly detecting continuous working sessions. A new activity tracking algorithm is proposed and implemented on a language learning platform named Zeeguu (\url{https://www.zeeguu.unibe.ch}). Accurate activity tracking increases reliability of data analysis and enables quality evaluation of the learning progress. The simplicity of the algorithm makes it applicable for areas even outside of the learning context.
