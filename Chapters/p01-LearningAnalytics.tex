Learning Analytics is the research area focused on collecting, analyzing and visualizing information \cite{Brown2011} related to the learning activities within a learning platform. Most of the current research focuses on Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle (\url{https://moodle.org/}) \cite{Park2015} \cite{Romero2008} or Blackboard (\url{https://www.blackboard.com}) \cite{Arnold2012}. The existing research therefore focuses on systems that emulate a virtual university, which collects data about students, courses enrollments, assignments, exams and grades.

\paragraph{Learning Management System}

Is the application that enables and manages all the educational content. Typically it also controls courses registration and tracks data about the students' progress. It also provides reports based on the collected data \cite{Watson2007}.\\


The nature of Personalized Textbooks implies that the learning road is different for each student, therefore the information collected for one user might not be the same for the rest (\Ie different subscriptions, the language being learned, the current level of knowledge, etc), making it more difficult to compare his learning performance against other students. Additionally, the level of detail is more specific than previous approaches. Other studies focused on analyzing grades and overall performance for different courses. The "personal" nature of Zeeguu, indicates that the information should be tracked for a specific article in a particular language. And because we want to track each individual reading or practice session.

In short, a new method for collecting and analyzing time spent on learning is required.
