%TODO mention interviews and extracted requirements from there, link to the appendinx as well

%TODO Some explanation about how this project was developed using a software engineering approach (SCRUM and software requirements and documentation)
During the results of the pilot test, students and professors gave feedback on their impressions of the system, therefore these feedback will be used as a starting point for designing a new visualization interface. The teachers will be contacted again because they know already the system and have experience in teaching with modern systems, so they will be a key evaluation factor for the projectâ€™s success. 
Existing research approaches will be used as starting point reference and their applicability for the particular problem of foreign language learning will be evaluated. 
Modern visualization design principles will be especially considered during the whole design process.

%TODO Explain material design

%TODO Explain session tracking

%TODO Explain algorithm (we can use the technical report)
