\chapter{Word knowledge}
%************************************************
According to a study done by \citeauthor{Webb2007}, orthography, grammatical function and syntax knowledge of a word can be greatly benefited by learning words in context. And the more repetitions of finding a word in different texts improve the vocabulary knowledge of foreign language students.
\citeauthor{Qian1999} makes a distinction between word knowledge breadth (number of known words) and depth (different meanings of the word knowledge). He mentions that in order to better comprehend texts in a foreign language is important not only to memorize a single translation of a word, but to learn it in different contexts so that different meanings of the word are learned.
