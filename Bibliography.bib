	abstract = {Since the creation of Web-based learning systems researchers have tried to make them adaptive to various characteristics of learners in order to increase the quality of learning. The application of data mining (DM) methods on learning system logs is often used as a basis of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have the ability for automatic adaptation of some aspect of the learning process. Such a system was developed at our institution in the previous years and has been used in a number of courses. To improve our system we added an integration application to create a continuous feedback loop with a DM tool. Our goals, from the student's perspective, are to improve the quality of knowledge acquired by students as well as shorten the learning time by offering recommendations based on mined patterns of learning paths through the knowledge domain. From the perspective of teachers, our goal is to create a rich data visualization system (in the form of a Web application using standard Web technologies to create visualizations) to give them new insight into students' behaviours. In this paper we present the structure of our system and the research design that will be used to verify its results.},

	abstract = {The Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) is an application to show students' online behavior patterns in a virtual learning environment. This supporting tool works by tracking students' log-files, mining massive amounts of data to find meaning, and visualizing the results so they can be comprehended at a glance. This paper reviews previously developed applications to analyze their features. Based on the implications from the review of previous studies as well as a preliminary investigation on the need for such tools, an early version of the LAD was designed and developed. Also, in order to improve the LAD, a usability test incorporating a stimulus recall interview was conducted with 38 college students in two blended learning classes. Evaluation of this tool was performed in an experimental research setting with a control group and additional surveys were conducted asking students' about perceived usefulness, conformity, level of understanding of graphs, and their behavioral changes. The results indicated that this newly developed learning analytics tool did not significantly impact on their learning achievement. However, lessons learned from the usability and pilot tests support that visualized information impacts on students' understanding level; and the overall satisfaction with dashboard plays as a covariant that impacts on both the degree of understanding and students' perceived change of behavior. Taking in the results of the tests and students' openended responses, a scaffolding strategy to help them understand the meaning of the information displayed was included in each sub section of the dashboard. Finally, this paper discusses future directions in regard to improving LAD so that it better supports students' learning performance, which might be helpful for those who develop learning analytics applications for students.},

In this context, learners are encouraged to share results of their work, opinions and experiences and to enrich the learn- ing experiences of their peers through comments that promote reflection and awareness on their activity. In order to support this open learning process, we provided the students with StepUp!, a student activity visu- alization tool. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation by students of this tool, and the comparison of results of two case studies.

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence for validity and reliability of popular consumer-wearable activity trackers (Fitbit and Jawbone) and their ability to estimate steps, distance, physical activity, energy expenditure, and sleep.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Searches included only full-length English language studies published in PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar through July 31, 2015. Two people reviewed and abstracted each included study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 22 studies were included in the review (20 on adults, 2 on youth). For laboratory-based studies using step counting or accelerometer steps, the correlation with tracker-assessed steps was high for both Fitbit and Jawbone (Pearson or intraclass correlation coefficients (CC) {\textgreater} =0.80). Only one study assessed distance for the Fitbit, finding an over-estimate at slower speeds and under-estimate at faster speeds. Two field-based studies compared accelerometry-assessed physical activity to the trackers, with one study finding higher correlation (Spearman CC 0.86, Fitbit) while another study found a wide range in correlation (intraclass CC 0.36-0.70, Fitbit and Jawbone). Using several different comparison measures (indirect and direct calorimetry, accelerometry, self-report), energy expenditure was more often under-estimated by either tracker. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were over-estimated and wake after sleep onset was under-estimated comparing metrics from polysomnography to either tracker using a normal mode setting. No studies of intradevice reliability were found. Interdevice reliability was reported on seven studies using the Fitbit, but none for the Jawbone. Walking- and running-based Fitbit trials indicated consistently high interdevice reliability for steps (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.76-1.00), distance (intraclass CC 0.90-0.99), and energy expenditure (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.71-0.97). When wearing two Fitbits while sleeping, consistency between the devices was high.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This systematic review indicated higher validity of steps, few studies on distance and physical activity, and lower validity for energy expenditure and sleep. The evidence reviewed indicated high interdevice reliability for steps, distance, energy expenditure, and sleep for certain Fitbit models. As new activity trackers and features are introduced to the market, documentation of the measurement properties can guide their use in research settings.},

However, there have not been enough studies to prove the accuracy and precision of these trackers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy, precision, and overall performance of seventeen wearable devices currently available compared with direct observation of step counts and heart rate monitoring.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Each participant in this study used three accelerometers at a time, running the three corresponding applications of each tracker on an Android or iOS device simultaneously. Each participant was instructed to walk 200, 500, and 1,000 steps. Each set was repeated 40 times. Data was recorded after each trial, and the mean step count, standard deviation, accuracy, and precision were estimated for each tracker. Heart rate was measured by all trackers (if applicable), which support heart rate monitoring, and compared to a positive control, the Onyx Vantage 9590 professional clinical pulse oximeter.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The accuracy of the tested products ranged between 79.8{\%} and 99.1{\%}, while the coefficient of variation (precision) ranged between 4{\%} and 17.5{\%}. MisFit Shine showed the highest accuracy and precision (along with Qualcomm Toq), while Samsung Gear 2 showed the lowest accuracy, and Jawbone UP showed the lowest precision.

@article{Ellis1993,
	abstract = {Abstract This paper reports a study of implicit and explicit learning of second language (L2) grammatical forms, the “soft”-mutations of Welsh. “Random” learners saw randomly ordered instances. “Rule” learners first learned the rules. “Rule{\&}Instances” learners saw the rules applied to instances. Initial learning, generalisations to new words and constructions, implicit fast performance in a well-formedness RT decision task, and explicit knowledge of the rules were recorded. Analyses of over 71,000 language trials demonstrate: (1) “Random” learners quickly achieve competence on original learning material, but show little implicit learning, performing poorly on well-formedness (or “grammaticality”) judgements, and have poor acquisition of explicit knowledge of the underlying rule-structure. (2) “Rule” learners take many trials to learn the rules but this facilitates their understanding of the natural language. However, they often know rules explicitly, yet fail to apply them in practice. Explicit and implic...},

@article{Kuppens2010,
	abstract = {A number of experimental studies have demonstrated the incidental acquisition of a foreign language by children and adolescents when watching foreign language television. While such experiments can only establish short-term effects, this article investigates the extent to which children's foreign language skills benefit from their long-term consumption of media. An empirical study conducted in the Flemish (Dutch-speaking) area of Belgium compared the self-reported use of three English language media by 374 pupils in the last year of primary education with their scores on two oral translation tests: one from Dutch to English and one vice versa. Two general linear model analyses of variance reveal that pupils who frequently watch subtitled English television programs and movies perform significantly better on both tests. Interestingly, the effect of watching subtitled television and movies is stronger with girls than with boys. Furthermore, playing English computer games positively influences the scores on the English–Dutch test.},
